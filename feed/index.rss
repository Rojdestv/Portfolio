				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s 9am on a Thursday and I’m taking the train into the city to make it to my 9:30am class at Gracehopper (FullStack Academy)&#8230;but let me backtrack to how i got here in the first place.</p>
<p>I came out of university with a finance and economics degree at an early age of 20. That same year I started my first job at Moody’s Corporation(a credit rating agency). For someone just coming out of university and in the finance field that was something to celebrate because Moody’s is a well known corporation and being on the banking team meant many doors were open for me to grow. Many colleagues would go on to work in big banks and they would be happy with that career path. I on the other hand couldn’t sit still because I knew I could do a lot more. I am so thankful that I didn’t give up looking and I stumbled upon coding, while on the job. I took initiative to learn our editorial program which uses html, worked on creating financial models using VBA and started a blog with wordpress. At work, I would be the main point of contact for the banking team for assistance with publishing reports with our editorial program(publishing reports was one of the main goals for any Moody’s analyst). Even with knowing that I had an interest in coding and seemed to work well with it I didn’t take it too seriously for a while and would keep searching for what I wanted.</p>
<p>My thoughts then, on switching to a coding career, were all fear driven. What if I’m not smart enough to code? Are women looked at differently in the coding world then men? Will I even like coding once I go out into the real world with it? How can I quit my stable, well paying job for something I’m not sure of? It was scary to make the decision especially since in the end, if it doesn’t work out, you lose a lot of money(tuition), a lot of time, a job with a stable paycheck and you wound your self esteem/pride(in the sense of I tried and failed). It’s because of those things that are scary that you should make a strong decision that you will follow through. If you do choose to do it, put your all into it, completely. Many things that are worth doing are scary, but I can bet that if you are unhappy with your current job you will regret being held back by fear to make a change. It may look like there is no light for you at the end of the tunnel but I can promise you there always is and always will be if you really do your very all and make the effort to find it. It will be worth it.</p>
<p>The below is what I did to help make my decision:</p>
<p>1. Step one is to try free coding courses online. You need to first understand if you can/will like working with code. There is almost an infinite amount of online material available for free. The ones I used were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codecademy</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Great for a beginner introduction to coding, the platform is nice to work with and the first few courses are free. Though it was definitely worth paying the monthly fee to finish their courses.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codewars</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A fun way to practice coding once you feel like you understand the basic concepts.</p>
<p>2. After you worked with a few courses, you will probably be wondering how much do I need to know to be able to get accepted into a bootcamp? For this, I highly recommend taking a bootcamp prep, I personally took FullStacks bootcamp &#8220;prep in a month&#8221; and found it beyond helpful as it gave me the exact knowledge i needed to practice/know, it was concise and went alot faster then if i had tried to figure out myself the span of knowledge and understand/practice the topics well.</p>
<p>3. Online vs in class? I highly recommend in class, i know there are some really great online programs like Thinkful and it would make sense to stay at your job and code after work..but there are some cons with online bootcamp that may bring you to give up all together on coding.</p>
<p>First its very difficult to do anything after work in general as it is demanding, you use all your energy towards you job and you could have long hours. If you think this doesn&#8217;t apply to you, just try it out =&gt; schedule a certain amount of hours that you should work on coding(for example 4 hours on codeacademy.com) every day after work and weekends. If you could do this without breaking schedule for at least a month and not feel burned out, you should be fine. For most people this will not be the case.</p>
<p>Second is online courses doesn&#8217;t hold you as accountable as in class, refer back to the above paragraph. In class bootcamps you have each hour scheduled with lectures and practice workshops. If you are stuck you have access to instructors instantly which saves you alot of confusion and time. In the beginning stages i feel it is crucial that you are struggling efficiently through workshops/problems rather then being stuck on one or many issues for hours.</p>
<p>Third is pair programming/ working in teams is taught in class bootcamps and is a very important part of the experience. Most jobs will require you to work with other people so learning this dynamic early on will be very helpful. This would cover how to communicate effectively, how to manage a project, how to delegate/ work on tasks together and an understanding of the project flow .</p>
<p>Fourth the emotional support and motivation from your peers and instructors. There are a lot of ups and downs when learning all these new topics and you don&#8217;t realize you need the push of  &#8220;you can get through this&#8221; or &#8220;i also feel this is a difficult topic&#8221; until you hear it and it really does help to know you and your peers are in the same boat.</p>
<p>4. Make sure before you quit your job or move you have a financial plan. All bootcamps are different, some have deferred tuition while some you need to pay upfront/installments. I really appreciate the deferred tuition model, which is available in Grace Hopper program in FullStack Academy, as you don&#8217;t need to worry about any payments until you find a job you am happy with. The tuition will then be taken out of the paycheck at your new job. It&#8217;s a win-win situation.</p>
